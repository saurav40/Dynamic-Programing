Given a fence with n posts and k colors, find out the number of ways of painting the fence 
so that not more than two consecutive fences have the same colors. Since the answer can be large return it modulo 10^9 + 7


class Solution
{
    long countWays(int n,int k)
    {
        //code here.
           long mod=1000000007;
        if(n==1)
          return k;
     
        long same=k*1%mod;
        long diff=(k*(k-1))%mod;
        long total=(same+diff)%mod;
        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++)
        {
            same=diff*1%mod;
            diff=(total*(k-1))%mod;
            total=(same+diff)%mod;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
